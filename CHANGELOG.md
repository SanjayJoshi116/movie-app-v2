# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.
Format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-07

### Added
- Info tooltips (`InfoCircleOutlined` + antd `Tooltip`, via new `src/components/InfoTooltip.tsx`) next to non-obvious labels/stats across Stats, Calendar, Lists, Watched, Recommendations, and Movie/TV Detail pages.
- Unified typography scale: `src/constants/typography.ts` (`FONT_SIZE.caption/body/emphasis/display`) replacing ~110 ad-hoc inline `fontSize` values across 28 files. Heading tokens pinned in `src/theme/antdTheme.ts`.
- `src/utils/formatDate.ts` (`formatDateDMY`) — dates now render as `dd-mm-yyyy` everywhere (Watched, Lists, Movie/TV Detail release date), independent of viewer locale.

### Fixed
- Release Calendar "Upcoming releases" label said "next 7 days" but actually fetched a 60-day window — label corrected to match behavior.
- Stats page activity-heatmap hover tooltip rendered far from the cursor — caused by `position: fixed` losing the viewport as its containing block under the page's `motion.div` transform. Tooltip now portals to `document.body` and tracks the live pointer position.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-26

Initial tracked baseline: React + TypeScript frontend, Django + PostgreSQL backend, JWT auth, TMDB-powered discovery, watchlist/watched/ratings/lists, recommendations, stats dashboard, release calendar.
